              Programming languages have been part of my life since childhood. 
              From the memories of MS-DOS, Visual Basic, Turbo Pascal and Norton Commander to the earliest versions of Windows 3.11, 
              passed on by the young developers making use of a dozen floppy disks, pilled up on the computer tower fueled by the most powerfull Pentium 80-286 at the time..
            </p>
            <p>
              The passion for programming continued through my highschool years at the Information Technology Institute, where Java was introduced as a new exciting language to discover.
              Shortly after my studies had to be put on hold due to a high amount of unmissable opportunities presented for my chefing career.   
            </p>
            <p>
              Years later, my research for becoming a web developer has led to finally enrolling for a six months fullstack programming bootcamp. Due to the fast pace of the course,
              many lessons were provided each week for the vast majority of the students. Assessments were often required to verify the progress of each student in order to provide 
              assistance when required. Therefore a lot of material was just brushed the surface of the massive extent like JavaScript, for example, in the short time availabe to cover.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the moment I have recently picked up my web dev learning opportunity being part of the Certificate IV of Information Technology in Web Developing. This will represent
              the changes that will make possible the transition from my career of Senior Chef to a more constructive and complex programming experience.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>Looking forward to collaborate together in the nearby exciting Future!!</p> -->
